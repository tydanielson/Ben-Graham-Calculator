# bgcalculator

A tool for pulling only the most important stock metrics and scoring stocks.  This is essentially a modified version of Ben Graham's rules.

##Install
To install all the required dependencies run:

``` bower install ```

##Run
You can use any webserver to host this.  I like to use `http-server`
